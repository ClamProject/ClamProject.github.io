                <h4>The CLAM network is secured through a unique system called Proof-of-Working-Stake (PoWS), or as we like to say, Digging for fresh CLAMs! PoWS is an evironmentally friendly alternative to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. Bitcoin's PoW requires that users solve increasingly difficult math problems. This has created a hardware arms race that consumes massive amounts of electricity worldwide. With CLAMs PoWS, it makes little difference if you’re using an ancient laptop or a quantum supercomputer!</h4>

                <h4>Approximately once per minute, the network automatically selects one running unlocked client with CLAMs to process recent CLAM transactions. This client is rewarded one CLAM. To understand PoWS, think of your CLAMs as raffle tickets. There’s a drawing each minute and the winner is rewarded with one freshly dug-up CLAM. While the prize always remains the same, your chances of winning vary according to how many tickets (CLAMs) you have. This PoWS system is the heart of the CLAM network, providing security and processing transactions.</h4>

                <h4>PoWS is an evironmentally friendly alternative to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. PoWS secures the CLAM network from double-spending just as PoW does for Bitcoin. The reward of 1 CLAM serves two fundamental purposes. It provides incentive for users to keep their clients running, which increases network security. The reward also helps to stabilize the CLAM price and supply over time by replenising CLAMs that are lost or destroyed by users.</h4>

                <h4>Proof-of-Working-Stake refers to CLAM’s unique implementation of Proof-Of-Stake. PoS conventionally provides reward to staking users in proportion to the age of the coins they stake with. This results in what essentially operates like “interest”. It also, however, removes the incentive for users to stake consistently and secure the network. There is no incentive to stake now, as opposed to later, if the reward for doing so will simply accrue until that user chooses to stake and claim it.</h4>

                <h4>PoWS, like traditional PoW, is designed to align incentives to stake with the benefit to the network of persistent competition for blocks. Therefore, a CLAM on the network is more akin to a PoW miner. A CLAM represents something somewhat similar to a unit of hashing power in a PoW network. If you do not stake (turn on your miner), you do not have the opportunity to be rewarded for securing the network.</h4>
