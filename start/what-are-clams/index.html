Similar to Bitcoin, the original technology on top of which CLAMS was created, this network follows a rigorous protocol to ensure that consensus and verification is maintained.</p></div>

To become a part of the CLAMS network, you need only to run the CLAMS software on your home computer. The purpose of this network is to independently and collaboratively verify the transfer and creation of CLAMs. The more people who join the CLAMs network, the stronger it gets.</p></div>
